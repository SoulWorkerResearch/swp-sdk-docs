# Install sdk

## With git

If you go the right way and use git, add sdk as a submodule to the root of the project.

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:SoulWorkerResearch/swp-sdk.git
```

## Without git

If you went the samurai way, just clone the repository in the root of the project.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SoulWorkerResearch/swp-sdk.git
```
